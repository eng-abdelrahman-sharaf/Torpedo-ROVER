1- line follower using cv OR [follow manually (- score)] 
2- print paths' lengths on GUI  

#CONTROL
1- installing micro-ros and test micro-ros
2- the ability to calculate the distance travelled (Test by moving the imu by hands no motors needed)
3- the ability to calculate the angle of rotation correctly 
4- implement Shift(distance , angle) using correct PID parameters
5- The ability to memorize its path and return to its entry point as array of {distance , degree} parameters passed to MOVE function
6- gripper 
7- get ultrasonic readings


x = 10
10-11 = -1 then grip


testing all components
