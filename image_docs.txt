using html css to make a well-locking web page to represent the gui of the rover

using rosbridge agent to be middle ware between ros2 and the web page as ros2 runs using tcp communication and webpages can't use tcp

detecting the line using by simulating the concept of ir sensors by dividing the screen into 3 parts the left (small part) the middle (biggest part) the right (small part)


problems:

connecting webpages to ros2 as they can't use tcp, the solution using ros_bridge or using pyqt to design using qt-designer which is a drag and drop application and simpler to use 

the mcu port wasn't defined, the solution was to disable brial tty which is made as an accessibility for blind people

the Linux broke down so we used ros2 on docker and learned that its important to give ubuntu good space and to give home a good portion of it 

connecting the camera to the laptop using wifi, used ipwebcam 

the camera has very high latency, the solution changing the resolution from the advanced ip webcam advanced settings 480x320
